    "description": "\n# Getting Started\nThe easiest way to get started with the Cloze API is to use an **API key** for authentication.\nYou can find directions and help on creating an API key at https://help.cloze.com/article/2176-api-key\n\nOnce you have an API key, you'll set the `api_key` query parameter to the API key you created in Cloze.\nWith this parameter set you can call any Cloze API.\nYou can try it with the [/v1/user/profile](#/paths/v1-user-profile/get) endpoint to make sure you have the right values.\nAlternatively, instead of as a query parameter, the API key can be provided to APIs as a\nbearer token in the Authorization header (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer ${api_key}`), the same way an Oauth2 access token is provided.\n\nIf you're building a public integration with Cloze (intended to be used by Cloze users outside your organization),\nto publish your integration **you must use the Open Authentication protocol** (OAuth 2.0) to authenticate\nwith Cloze user accounts. You can, however, do your initial development and testing using an API key.\nContact support@cloze.com to get you started on building and publishing an oauth-enabled Cloze integration.\n\nTo import the Cloze APIs into tools such as PostMan, tap on the Export button in the upper right.\n\n# Using the API\nBecause the Cloze API is used in many industries for many different purposes, the API itself is\nvery generic. While there are common elements, much of the use-case specific data is managed\nthrough a combination of stages, segments, steps, and custom fields. The APIs in the *Account*\ncategory allow you to retrieve the metadata related to these.\n\nNote, however, that custom fields are schemaless (unless you explicitly pass `\"validation\": \"schema\"`).\nThat means you can store and manage data in custom fields even if they aren't configured or exposed in\nthe Cloze UI.\n"

        "description": "This method allows you to subscribe to notifications from Cloze such as when a ***relation(person, project, or company)*** changes.\nNotifications are delivered using Web hooks, the callback URL, *target_url* is supplied in the subscription.\n\n### Event Types\nFor subscriptions that monitor *changes*, there are two event types:\n\n***relation audit changes*** - notifications co-incide with Cloze audit trail entries(that appear in the\nCloze timeline views) and contain the ***audited before and after changes*** in addition to the *person*, *project*, or\n*company*.\n\n***relation changes*** - *person*, *project*, or *company* is delivered on *any* change to a relation, *changes* information is empty.\n\n### Subscription Scope\nFor **team users with export team data rights**, changes may be monitored against the team's relations or against the user's own local\nrelations. A ***scope*** property, ***team***, ***local***, or prefix, ***hierarchy:***  sets this. By default *team users\nwith export team data rights* subscribe to *team* relation changes. All other users may subscribe to their own local relations;\nthey are not authorized to subscribe to team or hierarchy changes. The *hierarchy:* prefixed scope is similar to *team* scope and may be\nused where  *hierarchies* are available. The *hierarchy:* scope allows you to see relations *at and below a position* in the hierarchy.\nThe following example shows all relations at the /USA/West sub-team level: _\"hierarchy:/USA/West\"_. To show relations at and below\nuse: _\"hierarchy:/USA/West/*\"_. To show relations at below the top team-level, and equivalent to _team_ scope,\nuse: _\"hierarchy:/*\"_.\n\n### Event Filters\nChange notifications may be filtered by Cloze by providing a ***filters*** specification.\n\n### Relation Filters\nRelation filters select which relations are examined for changes:  what type of relation (person,\nproject, or company), and what values certain specified properties must have, to generate a webhook\nnotification.\n\nExample:  Filter for people in segment \"Buyer\", stage \"Warm\" with specific values for custom fields\n`lead-origin` and `lead-source`\n```\n{\n    \"person\":\n    {\n        \"segment\": \"Buyer\",\n        \"stage\": \"Warm\",\n        \"customFields\":\n        [\n            { \"id\": \"lead-origin\", \"value\": \"team\" },\n            { \"id\": \"lead-source\", \"value\": \"zillow\" }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Change Filters\nChange filters determine which types of audit changes generate webhook notifications for the subscription.\nAudit changes include changes to the relation's `segment`, `stage`,  and changes to any of the relation's\ncustom fields.\n\nNote:  change filters are only applicable for relation audit change subscriptions - `person.audit.change`,\n`project.company.change` or `company.audit.change`.\n\nExample: changes in a person's stage from \"lead\" to any other stage\n```\n{\n    \"changes\":\n    {\n        \"stage\": { \"before\": \"Lead\", \"after\": \"*\" }\n    }\n}\n```\nExample: only changes where the custom field \"is-contacted\" has been set to \"Yes\"\n```\n{\n    \"changes\":\n    {\n        \"is-contacted\": { \"after\": \"Yes\" }\n    }\n}\n```\nExample: For custom fields you can use the field name instead of the unique id.\n```\n{\n    \"changes\":\n    {\n        \"Is Contacted\": { \"after\": \"Yes\" }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor subscriptions to relation audit changes, you can combine both relation filters and change filters -\nfor example, this filter limits notifications to people in segment `\"Buyer\"`, stage `\"Warm\"`, with specific\n`lead-source` and `lead-origin` values, and only when the `is-contacted` custom field is changed to Yes\n\n```\n{\n    \"person\":\n    {\n        \"segment\": \"Buyer\",\n        \"stage\": \"Warm\",\n        \"customFields\":\n        [\n            { \"id\": \"lead-origin\", \"value\": \"team\" },\n            { \"id\": \"lead-source\", \"value\": \"zillow\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"changes\":\n    {\n        \"is-contacted\": { \"after\": \"Yes\" }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Notification Format\nChange notifications for *relations* are delivered as a array of objects. Each relation is delivered in a format that is\nidentical(symmetrical) to that used to add(or change) the relation. Please refer to the *Relations* section for\ndetails.\n\n### HTTP Headers\nAll change notifications will contain an HTTP header, ***X-Cloze-Subscription-ID***, which contains the uniqueid assigned to\nthe subscription. For subscriptions that are created with a client reference, the client reference is provided in the\nHTTP header, ***X-Cloze-Client-Reference***.\n\n### Webhook Response\nChange notifications must be responded to with a proper confirmation response. The following forms of confirmation response\nare accepted:\n\n  * *text/plain* content-type and body *OK*\n  * *application/json* content-type and body *{ \"status\" : \"ok\" }*\n\n### Notification Retry and Suspension\nAny other form of response(other than legitimate failures) will result in immediate suspension of the subscription.\n\nSubscriptions will also be suspended if notifications are redirected more than 2 times.\n\nThe following conditions are considered failures that may be retried:\n\n  * The notification fails to receive a response within *10 seconds*\n  * A status code outside the range of 200–4xx is received\n  * A network error is encountered\n\nAudit change subscriptions will be retried up to 3 times, using exponential backoff\nat 30 seconds, then 90 seconds, then 270 seconds. Subscriptions to basic relation changes are retried\none time after 30 seconds.\n\nThe overall rate of notification success is monitored over daily periods: if there are at least 15\nnotification failures over a day period, and the overall failure rate over the period rises above 10%,\nthe subscription will be suspended\n\nExcessive or unresponsive notifications during day, hour and minute periods may also lead to the\nsubscription being suspended by Cloze:\n\n* More than 5 failures per minute\n* More than 10 failures per hour\n* More than 25 failures per day\n\nOnce a subscription is suspended, it can be reactivated in one of two ways:\n\n * Manually by the target account user, in Settings -> Webhooks\n * By unsubscribing and re-subscribing programmatically\n",

Use this to retrieve\nthe next batch of records by passing this in the _cursor_ query parameter of the next request. Don't forget to add\nany required API keys and user identification to the request. In streaming mode, API clients should handle\nthe case that occurs after the initial or afterwards where the stream is quiet and no records are available.\nIn all cases, use the returned _cursor_ to form the next request and implement suitable polling\nto receive new records as changes occur.\n",
